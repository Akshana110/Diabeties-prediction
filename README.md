# Diabeties-prediction
🔄 Project Workflow

1. Diabetes Dataset
Raw diabetes data is collected for model training.

2. Data Pre-processing
Missing values, scaling, and feature preparation are performed to clean the dataset.

3. Train–Test Split
The processed data is divided into training and testing sets.

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
The SVM model is trained on the training data to learn patterns distinguishing diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

5. Model Training
A trained SVM classifier is obtained and evaluated.

6. Prediction on New Data
New patient input is passed to the trained model to predict whether the person is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic.
